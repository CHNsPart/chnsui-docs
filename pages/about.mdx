# About

I'm Touhidul Islam Chayan, a software engineer specializing in front-end development, UI/UX design, and machine learning. I have experience with independent international clients and full-time jobs, honing my skills in various technologies.

My expertise is in JavaScript, with a focus on front-end development using Next.JS and Vite with Sass or Tailwind CSS. For back-end development, I use Node.JS and its frameworks, including Express.JS and Nest.JS. Additionally, I'm a skilled UI/UX designer, creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

In the field of machine learning, I have experience with deep learning and pre-trained models. I've published research on IEEE in the computer vision field, where I used these techniques to predict glaucoma with an accuracy of 94.71% and its explanation.
